# ANDROID-AUTHENTICITY-PREDICTION
Android malware is a malicious programs than can harm or damage the entire system or corrupt and leak the sensitive data of the user in wrong hands. Thus it becomes much important to classify this app as malicious or benign before user downloads and use it.

For this purpose we are provided with a dataset consisting of approximately 30,000 records. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis, handled duplicate & missing values, Balanced dataset by Oversampling Method, monitored feature correlation This is a type of binary classification. 

There are various different machine learning algorithms for classification problem, we used Random Forest, K - nearest neighbor, decision tree, logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, support vector Machine also for hyper parameter tuning used Randomized search CV and for this case I found out Gradient Boosting Classifier has Accuracy
